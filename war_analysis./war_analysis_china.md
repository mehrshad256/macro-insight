Is Asia on the brink of a geopolitical flashpoint?

Recent GPS disruptions near Taiwan and the South China Sea, combined with intensified Chinese military drills and aggressive media messaging, suggest rising regional tension â€” and possibly preparation for limited conflict.

If war breaks out, market implications could be severe:

 Dow Jones may drop to 30,000

   Gold could surge to $4,000

 USD index likely to strengthen sharply

OPECâ€™s decision to boost energy reserves hints at anticipation of future instability. Additionally, if Iran â€” however unlikely â€” attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz, it would amplify energy risks and global volatility.
We may be entering one of the most fragile geopolitical phases of the decade. Businesses and investors should stay alert and scenario-ready.
