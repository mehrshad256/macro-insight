##Is Asia on the brink of a geopolitical flashpoint?

##Recent GPS disruptions near Taiwan and the South China Sea, combined with intensified Chinese military drills and aggressive media messaging, suggest rising regional tension â€” and possibly preparation for limited conflict.

##If war breaks out, market implications could be severe:

 ##   Dow Jones may drop to 30,000

 ##   Gold could surge to $4,000

  ##  USD index likely to strengthen sharply

##OPECâ€™s decision to boost energy reserves hints at anticipation of future instability. Additionally, if Iran â€” however unlikely â€” attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz, it would amplify energy risks and global volatility.

##We may be entering one of the most fragile geopolitical phases of the decade. Businesses and investors should stay alert and scenario-ready.
