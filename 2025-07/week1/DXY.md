    RSI Divergence Observed
    On the DXY chart, we observe a hidden bullish divergence in the RSI, where price makes a higher low while RSI makes a lower low.
    This pattern suggests potential continuation of the uptrend despite short-term corrections.

🧮 Fundamental Overview

    ADP Employment Report (Wednesday)

        Expected stronger results could support the dollar’s bullish trend through next week.

        Watch for surprise upside in employment numbers.

    NFP Index
