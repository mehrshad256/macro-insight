If the price reaches the 1.1755 area, I will sell there. Otherwise, and if the TP trend line breaks, first to the area and then breaks and pullbacks to 1.67, I will sell to 1.6.
ðŸ“‰ EUR/USD â€“ Weak Expectations, Neutral German CPI, and Bearish Momentum Ahead

Bias: Short / Sell Setup

EUR/USD recently surged toward the 1.0750 zone sooner than expected, driven more by market optimism and speculative flows than solid fundamentals.
Now, that optimism is starting to fade as data fails to back it up.

Meanwhile, the potential U.S. tax reform proposal (Trump) and signs of renewed trade negotiations are helping shift sentiment back toward the U.S. dollar in the coming 10 days.

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German CPI â€“ Neutral Print, But Bearish Implications

Today's regional inflation figures across German states were mixed:

States like Saxony and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg showed slightly rising prices

Others like Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia showed declining YoY inflation

Final national CPI due later today is unlikely to beat expectations meaningfully


ðŸŽ¯ Summary: A Neutral CPI Print

No upside surprise â†’ No support for EUR
No major downside â†’ No panic either
