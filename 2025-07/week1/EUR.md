If the price reaches the 1.1755 area, I will sell there. Otherwise, and if the TP trend line breaks, first to the area and then breaks and pullbacks to 1.67, I will sell to 1.6.
📉 EUR/USD – Weak Expectations, Neutral German CPI, and Bearish Momentum Ahead

Bias: Short / Sell Setup

EUR/USD recently surged toward the 1.0750 zone sooner than expected, driven more by market optimism and speculative flows than solid fundamentals.
Now, that optimism is starting to fade as data fails to back it up.

Meanwhile, the potential U.S. tax reform proposal (Trump) and signs of renewed trade negotiations are helping shift sentiment back toward the U.S. dollar in the coming 10 days.

🇩🇪 German CPI – Neutral Print, But Bearish Implications

Today's regional inflation figures across German states were mixed:

States like Saxony and Baden-Württemberg showed slightly rising prices

Others like Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia showed declining YoY inflation

Final national CPI due later today is unlikely to beat expectations meaningfully


🎯 Summary: A Neutral CPI Print

No upside surprise → No support for EUR
No major downside → No panic either

📉 **Eurozone Economy and ECB Policy: Navigating Between Stability and Currency Strength**

Recent economic data from the Eurozone indicates a relatively stable and controlled environment. Key indicators such as GDP growth, employment, and inflation are within acceptable ranges. Inflation currently hovers around 1.9%, slightly below the ECB’s target, and growth is positive though moderate.

However, the recent sharp appreciation of the euro adds complexity to the ECB’s policy decisions. While classic economic theory suggests that a stable economy with subdued inflation is a green light for lowering interest rates to stimulate growth, the reality is more nuanced.

The euro’s strength — fueled partly by the weakening U.S. dollar and capital inflows — poses risks to Eurozone exporters by reducing competitiveness and could potentially slow economic growth if it persists. Therefore, the ECB faces a delicate balancing act:

Cutting rates could support growth but may further strengthen the euro, exacerbating export challenges.

Slowing down or pausing rate cuts could help temper the euro’s rise but risks slowing the recovery.


This interplay perfectly illustrates George Soros’ theory of reflexivity in markets — where market perceptions and actions influence fundamentals and vice versa.

> As Soros said,
"Market prices are always distorted by prevailing biases."



Investors’ reactions to ECB policy, currency moves, and economic data feed back into the market itself, creating a self-reinforcing cycle.

If the euro’s rise exceeds expectations, this can trigger sudden, emotion-driven investment decisions, increasing volatility beyond what fundamentals would suggest.

⚠️ Key Takeaways:

Economic data supports a controlled, stable Eurozone economy.

The effects of currency appreciation on data will manifest with delay.

ECB’s monetary policy decisions are constrained by currency dynamics.

Reflexivity in markets means price moves and investor sentiment continually shape each other.
